# Getting Started with Core web3-react connector

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We then installed `@avalabs/avalanche-connector`. After that you can open `src -> context -> web3Connection.context.tsx`

This is meant to be the simplest example as possible and thus only deals with connecting dApps to the Core extension.

## Connect to Core Button

You can open `src -> pages -> connect.tsx` to see a VERY rudementary version of the checking for Core connector.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
